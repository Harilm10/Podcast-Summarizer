# Podcast-Summarizer https://uplimitpodcast-harilogan.streamlit.app/
In this project, I built an LLM app that summarizes a podcast episode, identifies podcast guests, identifies key highlights, and more! 

Part 1: Used a large language model from OpenAI to build the information extraction functionality, paired with a speech-to-text model for transcribing the podcast.

Part 2: Used a simple cloud deployment provider "Modal" to easily convert the information extraction function to run on demand â€“ This would be the app backend.

Part 3: Used ChatGPT from OpenAI as coding assistant to create and deploy a front-end that allows users to experience the end-to-end functionality in Sreamlit.
